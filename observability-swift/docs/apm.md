This document explains the differences and motivations behind using Beats (like Filebeat and Metricbeat) instead of Elastic Agent (with Fleet), especially when integrating with OpenTelemetry or using a backend-agnostic observability approach.

---

## üîç Overview

### Beats
Beats are lightweight, single-purpose data shippers (e.g., Filebeat for logs, Metricbeat for metrics). They can run independently and are highly configurable using YAML files. Beats can send data to multiple destinations including Logstash, Kafka, Elasticsearch, or even OpenTelemetry Collectors.

### Elastic Agent + Fleet
Elastic Agent is a unified agent that can collect logs, metrics, and traces. It is managed centrally via Fleet (typically in Kibana) and is tightly integrated into the Elastic Stack.

### OpenTelemetry
OpenTelemetry is a CNCF project that standardizes instrumentation across logs, metrics, and traces. It promotes vendor-neutral observability and can export data to different backends (e.g., Prometheus, Jaeger, Tempo, Elasticsearch).

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison

| Feature                        | Beats                 | Elastic Agent + Fleet          |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Granularity**               | Each Beat does one thing (Filebeat, Metricbeat, etc.) | One unified agent |
| **Independence**              | Standalone ‚Äì no Fleet server needed | Requires Fleet server (usually via Kibana) |
| **Backend Flexibility**       | Supports Kafka, Logstash, OTEL, etc. | Tightly coupled with Elastic Stack |
| **Configurability**           | YAML based, full control | Centrally managed through UI |
| **Resource Footprint**        | Lightweight            | Heavier, unified agent |
| **OpenTelemetry Support**     | Works with OTEL Collector pipelines | Agent supports OTEL but within Elastic scope |

## üß† Why Use Beats with OpenTelemetry?

Using Beats in combination with Kafka and the OpenTelemetry Collector is a great way to:

- **Avoid vendor lock-in** (Elastic-only dashboards or APM)
- **Send telemetry to multiple backends** (Grafana, Jaeger, etc.)
- **Separate ingestion and processing layers** for more resilient pipelines

Example:
```
Beats ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí OpenTelemetry Collector ‚Üí Elasticsearch + Jaeger + Prometheus
```

This pipeline is flexible, composable, and production-grade.

## ‚úÖ When to Choose What?

| Use Case                          | Recommended Tool       |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Lightweight metric/log shipper   | Beats                  |
| Centralized agent management     | Elastic Agent + Fleet  |
| Multi-backend support            | OpenTelemetry + Beats  |
| Elastic-native APM dashboards    | Elastic Agent          |

## Conclusion

Using Beats gives more flexibility in hybrid or multi-backend environments. While Elastic Agent with Fleet is convenient for Elastic-only setups, combining Beats with Kafka and OpenTelemetry provides an open, powerful, and decoupled observability platform.
